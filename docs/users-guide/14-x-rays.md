## X-rays
---
X-rays are a fast and easy way to get automatic insights and explorations of your data.

### Exploring newly added datasets

When you first connect a database to Metabase, Metabot will offer to show you some automated explorations of your data.

Click on one of these to see an x-ray.

You can see more suggested x-rays over on the right-hand side of the screen. If you come across an x-ray that's particularly interesting, you can save it as a dashboard by clicking the green Save button.

### Creating x-rays by clicking on charts or tables

One great way to explore your data in general in Metabase is to click on points of interest in charts or tables, which shows you ways to further explore that point. We've added x-rays to this action menu, so if you for example find a point on your line chart that seems extra interesting, give it a click and x-ray it! We think you'll like what you see.

### X-rays in the Data Reference

You can also create an x-ray by navigating to a table, field, metric, or segment in the [Data Reference](./12-data-model-reference.md). Just click the x-ray link in the left sidebar.

### Where did the old x-rays go?

We're reworking the way we do things like time series growth analysis and segment comparison, which were present in the previous version of x-rays. In the meantime, we've removed those previous x-rays, and will bring those features back in a more elegant and streamlined way in a future version of Metabase.
